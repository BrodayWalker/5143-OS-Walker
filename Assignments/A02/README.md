# A02 OpenMP

## How To Compile
For this assignment, I compiled each program using the following command structure:
``g++ <my_file>.cpp -o <my_file.exe> -fopenmp``

## Hardware
#### Intel Core i7-7700k
The test program in the folder was run on my personal computer, which features an Intel i7-7700k running at 4.2GHz.  All chip information was gathered from [wikichip](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/core_i7/i7-7700k).
