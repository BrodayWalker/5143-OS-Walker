&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiprocessing, Multiprogramming, Multithreading, and Multitasking all stem from the Operating System's (OS) need to efficiently manage a finite set of resources in a system where many processes, threads, and programs are competing for CPU time. The four multi techniques are employed by the OS with one primary goal in mind: to increase real or perceived throughput of computation. 

# Define Multiprocessing, Multiprogramming, Multithreading, Multitasking:
* [Multiprocessing](https://github.com/rugbyprof/5143-Operating-Systems/wiki/Hardware):  A computer using more than one CPU at a time.
* [Multiprogramming](https://github.com/rugbyprof/5143-Operating-Systems/wiki/Software): A computer running more than one program at a time {slack, Visual Studio & Firefox}
* [Multithreading](https://github.com/rugbyprof/5143-Operating-Systems/wiki/Software):   An extension of multitasking. 
* [Multitasking](https://github.com/rugbyprof/5143-Operating-Systems/wiki/Hardware):     Task sharing a common resource.
