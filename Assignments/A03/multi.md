## Multiprocessing Multiprogramming Multithreading Multitasking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiprocessing, Multiprogramming, Multithreading, and Multitasking all stem from the Operating System's (OS) need to efficiently manage a finite set of resources in a system where many processes, threads, and programs are competing for CPU time. The four multi techniques are employed by the OS with one primary goal in mind: to increase real or perceived throughput of computation.
